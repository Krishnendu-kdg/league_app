# League of Legends Stat App (Better name needed) (WIP)

This project is currently hosted on a Heroku app here:

https://league-stat-tracker.herokuapp.com/

The idea for this project is to allow League of Legends players to track statistics not available to them regularly.
I am open to any ideas for new features or changes, feel free to open an issue!

** THIS WILL BE IMPROVED VERY SOON, if there is anything specific you want here, please raise an issue. I hope to flesh this out by end of day 10/5 ***
